      <p>The Battle For Le Fleuve!\n Dylan Brunelle (2022)\n\nHere's a game I've been working on for the past month.\n 
          The Battle For Le Fleueve is a real-time strategy game in which the player enlists various troops to take down\n
      the enemy castle. This style of game is nothing new, and I had many places to look for inspiration, such as Civilization,\n
      Clash Royale, and Bloons Tower Defense. However, the actual contents of this game are far less important to the project as a whole.\n
      As a novice programmer with a dream of working in game design, I was able to experience first-hand the process behind game developement.\nI
      found that while adding detailed sprites and cool new mechanics can be technically impressive, making the experience fun for the user was\n
      the greatest challange to overcome. There were many obstacles I faced for an overall lack-luster result, but frankly, the experience I gained\n
      from this project is invaluable, and I can't wait to see the quality of my work improve in the future. \n\nTo play, scroll down and zoom out your browser.</p>
